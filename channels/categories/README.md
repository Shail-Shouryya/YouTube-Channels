<summary><strong>Alien Babies Podcast description</strong></summary>

- Alien Babies Podcast is for the alien babies that like UFOs, ghosts, paranormal experiences, comedy & being an entrepreneur. Like the Joe Rogan Experience minus the politics & more UFOs. We also talk about following your dreams and unplugging from the 9-5 matrix. There is also a LIVE version of this podcast where I interview people about their UFO, ghost, and paranormal experiences in an open minded setting.
- We're all about welcoming people that have had incredible experiences. It's a place to be heard and not judged about the unbelievable things we have seen. Often times when you tell people your stories, they look at you like you're crazy. This podcast gives people a voice and a platform to tell their stories and not feel bad about it.

<summary><strong>Rich Roll Description</strong></summary>

Thanks for stopping by! I used to be an unhealthy corporate lawyer. At 40 I decided to change my life. I switched to a 100% plant-based diet, lost 50 pounds and started exploring human potential across a spectrum of disciplines: ultra-endurance, wellness, nutrition, mindfulness and spirituality.

Now 54, I travel the world sharing what I have learned in talks, books, and on my podcast. I'm also a dad to 4 kids & live in Malibu, California.
